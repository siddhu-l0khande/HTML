        <section><h2>"species of <u>Dolfins</u> : </h2>
        <p id="speices of Dolfin"> Currently there are 42 dolphin species which are grouped into five families: the oceanic dolphin family is by far the largest with 38 members; and there are four river dolphin families.. However, classification is not an exact science and as more information and discoveries come to light, deliberations will continue and some dolphin species are likely to be further split into more than one species and/or subspecies.

            Names and nick names can certainly be confusing; there are eight dolphin names that feature the word ‘whale’, including pilot whales, killer whales, false killer whales and melon-headed whales. Two species have whale and dolphin in their name; the northern right whale dolphin and the southern right whale dolphin – no wonder both the public and scientists get confused!</p>

            <p id="The biggest dolfin">The biggest member of the dolphin family is the orca (killer whale). 
                The larger males grow up to 9.8m (32ft 2in) and weigh up to 10,000kg (22,046lbs). Their black, towering dorsal fins grow up to 2m (6ft 7in) and are unique among all whales and dolphins. At birth, orcas are 2.1 to 2.6m (6ft 11in - 8ft 6in).</p>
